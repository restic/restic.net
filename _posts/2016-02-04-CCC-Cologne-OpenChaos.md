On Friday, 30 January [fd0](https://github.com/fd0) gave a talk at the [Chaos
Computer Club Cologne (C4) e.V.](http://koeln.ccc.de) in Cologne, Germany in
their monthly series of public lectures called OpenChaos. Unfortunately for our
international readers the talk was given in German.

[The recording](https://media.ccc.de/v/c4.openchaos.2016.01.restic) is embedded
below. If you've watched the talk and have a question or other feedback, please

feedback!
