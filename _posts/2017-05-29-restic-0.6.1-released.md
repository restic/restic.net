We've just released [restic 0.6.1](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/tag/v0.6.1)!

Just a few days after the release of restic 0.6.0 we've released 0.6.1 as a bugfix release to address two annoying bugs. The changes are listed below.

This is the first release of restic that uses the new [build Docker container](https://github.com/restic/builder) which allows you to reproduce a byte identical version of the released binaries. This is called [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/).

For downloading the code, head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/tag/v0.6.1).
As always, thanks for [reporting any issues](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) you encounter!

Important Changes in 0.6.1
==========================

 * We've fixed a bug where `rebuild-index` would corrupt the index when used
   with the s3 backend together with the `default` layout. This is not the
   default setting.

 * Backends based on HTTP now allow several idle connections in parallel. This
   is especially important for the REST backend, which (when used with a local
   server) may create a lot connections and exhaust available ports quickly.

 * Regular status report: We've removed the status report that was printed
   every 10 seconds when restic is run non-interactively. You can still force
   reporting the current status by sending a `USR1` signal to the process.

 * The `build.go` now strips the temporary directory used for compilation from
   the binary. This is the first step in enabling reproducible builds.
