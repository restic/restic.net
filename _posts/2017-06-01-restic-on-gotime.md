title: "restic on GoTime #48"
---

Last week [Alex](https://github.com/fd0) had the honour to join [Ashley](https://twitter.com/ashleymcnamara), [Erik](https://twitter.com/erikstmartin), and [Brian](https://twitter.com/bketelsen) at [GoTime](https://gotime.fm). GoTime is a podcast about Go, the community, and everything in between. It was a lot of fun (and he got to do the intro in German). The episode can be found on the [website](https://changelog.com/gotime/48), you can also listen to it right here:
