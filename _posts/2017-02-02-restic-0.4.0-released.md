We've just released [restic 0.4.0](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/tag/v0.4.0). This release will use much less memory during certain operations (notably `prune`, but also during backup). There have also been some major internal changes which will hopefully contribute to an even larger improvement in memory usage.

As always, thanks for [reporting any issues](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) you encounter!
