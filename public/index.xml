      <description>We are happy to announce the release of restic 0.15.0!
In this version, a new rewrite command has been implemented. This allows for removing unwanted data from existing snapshots, for example if you discover that some files were unintentionally backed up, such as files with sensitive content or files that take up a lot of space and don&amp;rsquo;t need to be backed up. Please see the corresponding documentation for more information and usage examples.</description>

This release contains a highly anticipated feature in restic - compression! To start using it, either initialize a new repository (which defaults to repository version 2 and therefore supports compression) or upgrade your current repository. The compression level can be changed from the default auto (fast and efficient) to max or off using the --compression option (or the corresponding environment variable).</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re proud to announce that restic 0.13.0 has been released today!
This release contains several bug fixes and improvements worth mentioning:
It is now possible to add negative patterns to cancel previous exclusions (e.g. --exclude &#39;/home/user/*&#39; --exclude &#39;!/home/user/.config&#39;). The backup command now has a --dry-run switch which (together with --verbose) prints the files that would be included in a backup. We have added checksums for various backends so data uploaded to a backend can be checked there.</description>

      <description>We have just released rest-server 0.10.0 which includes a few potentially breaking changes. For details, please see the changes described in the release.
This release corrects a security issue. User wojas discovered that it was possible to access repositories belonging to other users. It was not possible to access directories outside of the path the repositories were stored in.
The rest-server has an option to allow users (identify by HTTP Basic authentication) to only access their own repository by specifying the --private-repos option.</description>

      <description>Like many other Open Source projects, restic uses GitHub for hosting the source code and managing issues. Over time, we discovered that oftentimes users open an issue on GitHub which just consists of a question, for example on how to use restic in a certain situation. While such issues can be answered quickly, sometimes there&amp;rsquo;s no consent on when the issue can be seen as resolved and therefore closed (the issue is not actionable).</description>

      <description>The restic project runs the unit and integration tests for each pushed commit and each pull request. We&amp;rsquo;re using Travis CI for Linux and OS X, and AppVeyor for Windows. We&amp;rsquo;re very grateful that they provide their services free of charge for Open Source projects!
Our project not only runs the tests on Travis, but also compiles restic for each supported architecture, operating system, and version of Go. Go is known for its fast compilation times, but still, compilation takes its time.</description>

      <description>Four years ago on 2014-04-06 fd0 added the first commit to what would later become the restic repository. At the time it was code-named khepri, but unfortunately the name wasn&amp;rsquo;t available on GitHub any more, so we had to find a different one.
At the moment, restic&amp;rsquo;s repository was starred on GitHub almost four thousand times. And we&amp;rsquo;ve collected 56 other backup tools along the way, helping countless people to discover backup programs (not necessarily restic alone).</description>

      <title>Using rclone as a restic Backend</title>

      <guid>https://restic.net/blog/2018-04-01/rclone-backend/</guid>
      <description>Originally, restic started with just two backends: local and sftp. Over time, many new backends were added so that restic is now able to store a repository on a variety of different cloud-based services. However, it became clear that each new backend we add for a new cloud service works slightly different and requires almost constant maintenance.
A while ago, Alex was contacted by Nick, who found restic by listening to the episode #48 of the GoTime podcast.</description>

      <title>Upcoming changes for the S3 backend</title>
      <link>https://restic.net/blog/2017-11-25/upcoming-changes-to-s3/</link>

      <description>TL;DR: If you&amp;rsquo;re using the s3 backend and cannot access your repo any more, append the path /restic to the repository location.
We&amp;rsquo;ve just merged Pull Request #1437 which resolves an issue with the S3 backend reported in #1292. When the next restic version is released (or you&amp;rsquo;re using the master branch directly), this may require modifying the repository location you&amp;rsquo;re passing to restic.
In order to access a repository stored on S3, restic requires the following information:</description>

      <description>TL;DR:
Under some circumstances, data in the repo was not stored properly This could have caused incomplete backups Upgrade restic to at least 0.7.1 and run restic rebuild-index before the next backup It is good practice to run restic check regularly Background We always knew that at some point there may be a more serious bug in restic that warrants a broader announcement. This is the story of how a small improvement that makes the code even more conservative lead to a small error which then caused a couple of unintended consequences.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve just released restic 0.4.0. This release will use much less memory during certain operations (notably prune, but also during backup). There have also been some major internal changes which will hopefully contribute to an even larger improvement in memory usage.

      <description>After two months development we&amp;rsquo;re proud to release restic version 0.3.0.
The most notable change is the addition of the prune and forget commands (we&amp;rsquo;ve covered them in an earlier blog post) which allow removing backups from the repository according to configurable criteria. Since this was one of the most requested features, now that it is implemented there&amp;rsquo;s really no excuse for not making backups any more!

      <title>Removing Snapshots</title>

      <guid>https://restic.net/blog/2016-08-22/removing-snapshots/</guid>
      <description>The feature that was most often requested feature for restic is the ability to remove snapshots from the repository. Sometimes, restic was even (rightfully) criticised for not having such a function.
After about three months of work, PR #518 was merged into the master branch a few days ago. This pull request brings two new commands to restic: forget and prune, which allows you to not only remove a single snapshot manually, but rather specify a policy according to which restic should automatically remove snapshots (so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to bother with them).</description>

      <description>Documentation in software projects is one of the things most developers hate. It is no secret that the docs always seem to be out of date.
In order to improve this situation for restic, since a few days ago the manual and documentation is part of the main restic repository. Having the documentation in the main repository means that all users have instant access to the exact version of the documentation they&amp;rsquo;ll need and developers can document new features in the same Pull Request they&amp;rsquo;re submitting the code.</description>

      <description>The restic project and all the source code, even this website is hosted by GitHub, and they provide an awesome service! This post describes how we sign releases of restic by using GnuPG so you can independently verify the integrity of the source code. In addition it is show how the automatically generated tar.gz files can be recreated with from the git repository.
Signing Git Tags In a git repository, &amp;ldquo;tags&amp;rdquo; can be created which basically are just named pointers to a commit, optionally annotated with other data.</description>

      <description>This post will explain Content Defined Chunking (CDC) and how it is used by restic.
Backup programs need to deal with large volumes of changing data. Saving the whole copy of each file again to the backup location when a subsequent (usually called &amp;ldquo;incremental&amp;rdquo;) backup is created is not efficient. Over time, different strategies have emerged to handle data in such a case.
In a backup program, data de-duplication can be applied in two locations: Removing duplicate data from the same or different files within the same backup process (inter-file de-duplication), e.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, you&amp;rsquo;ve found your way to the restic development blog, awesome! Let me welcome you on behalf of the whole development team.
In this blog we&amp;rsquo;ll publish articles that explain the foundation techniques that restic is built upon and will give some insights into what&amp;rsquo;s happening on the development side of restic. Once restic is widely in use, we&amp;rsquo;ll probably shift the focus a bit towards the user perspective of backups and present tips and tricks for using restic more efficiently.</description>
