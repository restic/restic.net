# Introduction

Restic is a modern backup program that can back up your files:

 * from **Linux, BSD, Mac and Windows**
 
 * to **many different storage types**, including self-hosted and online services

 * **easily**, being a single executable that you can run without a server or complex setup

 * **effectively**, only transferring the parts that actually changed in the files you back up

 * **securely**, by careful use of cryptography in every part of the process

 * **verifiably**, enabling you to make sure that your files can be restored when needed

 * **freely** - restic is entirely free to use and completely open source

## Quickstart

A short recorded demo of restic:

To learn more about restic, checkout the user manual:

 * [Manual for restic (released version)](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
 * [Manual for restic (latest development version)](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Installation

To install, please follow the [Installation Instructions Page](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/020_installation.html) in the manual or download the latest native binary on the [GitHub Download Page](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/latest).

## Compatibility

Backward compatibility for backups is important so that our users are always able to restore saved data. Therefore restic follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) to clearly define which versions are compatible. The repository and data structures contained therein are considered the "Public API" in the sense of Semantic Versioning.

Once version 1.0.0 is released, we guarantee backward compatibility of all repositories within one major version; as long as we do not increment the major version, data can be read and restored. We strive to be fully backward compatible to all prior versions.

During initial development (versions prior to 1.0.0), maintainers and developers will do their utmost to keep backwards compatibility and stability, although there might be breaking changes without increasing the major version.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! More information can be found in [the restic contribution guidelines](https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). A document describing the design of restic and the data structures stored on disc is contained in [the design document](http://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/100_references.html#design).
