We are happy to announce the release of [restic 0.16.3](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/v0.16.3)!

This release fixes a couple of bugs on Windows and in the `restore` command. It also works around an unlikely yet possible situation with `rclone` which could potentially result in data loss. Please upgrade to this new restic version to make sure you are not affected.

To download the new release and to see a more detailed list of important changes, please head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/v0.16.3). If you already have restic (0.9.4 or later), you can use the `self-update` command to automatically download and verify the new release.

As always, thanks for [reporting any issues](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new/choose) you encounter! To get help or provide feedback, please write a post in [the forum](https://forum.restic.net).
