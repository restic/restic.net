We have just released [REST-server 0.13.0](https://github.com/restic/rest-server/releases/tag/v0.13.0).

This release of REST-server supports listening on unix sockets and also handles signals better than previous releases. Due to dependency updates REST-server now requires Go 1.18 to build.

Please see the [changelog](https://github.com/restic/rest-server/releases/tag/v0.13.0) for more specific information!
