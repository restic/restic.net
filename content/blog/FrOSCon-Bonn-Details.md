We'll get a project room for the afternoon, the room number will be announced as an update to this blog entry, [on Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@restic) and in [the forum](https://forum.restic.net).

It'd be nice to know how many of you will be able to join us, so please leave a comment in the [GitHub issue #1110](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1110) or in the forum. We're looking forward to meeting you all, thanks!
