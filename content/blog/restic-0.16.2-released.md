We are happy to announce the release of [restic 0.16.2](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/v0.16.2)!

This release restores support for ARMv5 which was accidentally not included in the previous one, and also fixes missing documentation on [Read the Docs](https://restic.readthedocs.io/).

To download the new release and to see a more detailed list of important changes, please head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/v0.16.2). If you already have restic (0.9.4 or later), you can use the `self-update` command to automatically download and verify the new release.

As always, thanks for [reporting any issues](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new/choose) you encounter! To get help or provide feedback, please write a post in [the forum](https://forum.restic.net).
