We're very pleased to announce [restic 0.15.2](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/v0.15.2)!

This release is primarily intended to address some minor bugs and cosmetic issues, but worth mentioning is that it is now possible to use the `ap-southeast-4` region (Melbourne) with S3. Also, official restic builds for the `riscv64` architecture on Linux are now available.

To download the new release and to see a more detailed list of important changes, please head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/v0.15.2). If you already have restic (0.9.4 or later), you can use the `self-update` command to automatically download and verify the new release.

As always, thanks for [reporting any issues](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new/choose) you encounter! To get help or provide feedback, please write a post in [the forum](https://forum.restic.net).
